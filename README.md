#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
     Is the process of designing,developing,testing and maintaining a software.
IMPORTANCE 
    software engineering helps businesses manage data efficiently.
    software engineering is essential for creating secure online platforms that facilitate transactions and protect sensitive customer information.
    Implementation of encryption protocols, secure payment gateways, and fraud detection systems.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
     Assembly language (1950s)-introduction of low level language that enabled programmers to directly control hardware.
     High level language(1950-1960s)-Development of languages like FORTRAN,COBOL AND BASIC.
    Structured programming(1960-a970s)-Introduction of concepts like modularityx,control structures to improve code readability and mainttainability.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Requirement gathering and analysis-define project goal and needs and aslo create software requirement specification.
    Software Design-define functional and non functional requirements.
    Implementaation-write and test code  based on design specification.
    Testing-verify that software meets requirements and also fix bugs and defects.
    Deployment-Releasse software to production environment.
    Maintainance-update software due to changes in requirements.  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
