#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
     Is the process of designing,developing,testing and maintaining a software.
     
IMPORTANCE 
    software engineering helps businesses manage data efficiently.
    software engineering is essential for creating secure online platforms that facilitate transactions and protect sensitive customer information.
    Implementation of encryption protocols, secure payment gateways, and fraud detection systems.
    
2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
     Assembly language (1950s)-introduction of low level language that enabled programmers to directly control hardware
     .
     High level language(1950-1960s)-Development of languages like FORTRAN,COBOL AND BASIC.
     
    Structured programming(1960-a970s)-Introduction of concepts like modularityx,control structures to improve code readability and mainttainability.
    
3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    Requirement gathering and analysis-define project goal and needs and aslo create software requirement specification.
    
    Software Design-define functional and non functional requirements.
    
    Implementaation-write and test code  based on design specification.
    
    Testing-verify that software meets requirements and also fix bugs and defects.
    
    Deployment-Releasse software to production environment.
    
    Maintainance-update software due to changes in requirements.
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    Waterfall methodology is where each phase is completed before moving to the other phase.Its requires high level of documentation,changes are dificult to make.
    Agile is where the project is brokken down into small chunnks called sprints.Are flexible and adptable,customer involvement throughout the process.
  Waterrfall methology is used in building large scale software system with stable requirements.
  Agile iis used in making mobile app with constantly evolving user needs.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
           Software developer
      Design,develop and implement software code.
      Collaborate with team members to create software solutions.
            Quality assurance engineer
      Test software products to identify and report defects.
      Perform functional,perfomance and regression testing.
             Project manager
      Plan,organise and manages a software development projects.
      Commuunicatees project progress status to stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
              IDEs
     Facilitate code editing-they offerr featuress like syntax highlighting and code navigation.
     simplifying debbing-allow developers to step thgrough code line to line.
     optimize compilation-built in compilersand build tools automate the compilation proocess and proviode detailed errorfor faster resolution.
           e.g intelliJ,visual studio,Eclipse,java.
          VCS
      Enable developers to maintain a central repository of code ensuring to ensure everyoone in the team is working.
      Allow developers to commit changes directly from with the latest version. 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Rapid technologyy changes, thhe industry is constantly evolving making it difficuult for them to keep up the lataest aadvancement.
    Lack of communication and collaboration which can be challenging in distributed teams.
    Pressure to quick delivery which includes tight deadline and demanding stakeholders.
         STRATEGIES
    Technical expertise-continuosly upgrade skills through trainig,workshops and certifications.
    Communication and collaboration-use clear and concise language when explaining technical concept.
    Project management-employ agile methodologies to manage proojects iteratively and increase flexibility.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
         UNIT
    Verifies the functionality of individual code interact  and work together.
  Ensures that the individual code componentt function as intended.
  Detects error earlier reducing the likelihood of defects propagatiinng to larger component
          INTERGRATION
     test hoow individual modules ineract with each other.
   Ensure that the overall system funcxtion smoothly as a unit.
   Identify potential intergratioon issues or conflict
          SYSTEM
      Test the compplete software system as a whole includiing all its component and interactioon.
   Validate the system functionality perfomance and stability. 
   Verifies that the system meets the users requirement and specificatiion.
         ACCEPTANCE
        Test the system from the users persepective to ensure that it meets their need and expectation.
   Confirms that thhe system is acceptable for deployment.
   Prevent costly reworks and user dissatisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
     Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear,comprehensive and effective promptss to guide AI models in generating the desired result.
    Enhances output quality-reduce ambiguity and lead to more relative output.
    Control over generation-buy adjustng the prompt users can control the style,the tone and conntent of AI models.
    Feedback and improvement-promptt serve as the feedbaackk for AI models,helping them to learn and improve perfomance.
    Collaboration and coommunication-prrompt facilitatee communicattion between human and AI moodels.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
         Vague prompt
    "write an exercise abouut the importance of exercise"
         Improved
       "Write an evidence-based article explorinng the specific health benefit of daily physical activity"
         importance oof improved
     Clear-specifies the topic or explanation.
     It clarifies the following activities, and memorable reasons.
